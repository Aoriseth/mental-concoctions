# Why this blog?

I always wanted to write and share thoughts with my friends and strangers who happen to be interested.

In the past I've mostly written to myself and accumulated a collection of notes and musings that others might find interesting, but I've always had difficulties deciding what to share and in what form to do it.

This blog will be my way of finally doing so. 

# What is this blog for?
I will mostly post:
- Recent ideas or inspirations
- Something cool I want to share, like a project or some insight
- Links to interesting things I found online

# What this blog will not be for
- Posting pictures of my daily life or vacations
- In-depth tutorials or instructions
- Promoting or selling anything of any kind
